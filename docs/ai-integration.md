# AI Integration Documentation

This document outlines how the AI components of StudyForge work.

## Document Processing

StudyForge uses AI to process uploaded documents (PDF, Word, text) and extract meaningful content.

### Process Flow

1. User uploads a document through the frontend
2. Backend processes and extracts text from the document based on file type
3. Text is sent to OpenAI API for analysis
4. AI divides the content into logical topics and suggests durations

## Topic Generation

### Algorithm

The AI analyzes the document to:

1. Identify natural chapter/section breaks
2. Recognize key concepts and themes
3. Determine logical groupings of content
4. Estimate the complexity and learning time required

### Example Prompt Structure

```
Analyze the following syllabus text and divide it into logical topics:
{extracted_text}

For each topic:
1. Create a title
2. Provide a brief summary
3. Estimate study time required (in minutes)
4. Suggest a deadline based on progressive difficulty
```

## Assessment Generation

### Difficulty Levels

StudyForge generates assessments at four difficulty levels:

1. **Easy**: Basic recall questions to test fundamental understanding
2. **Medium**: Application-based questions requiring deeper comprehension
3. **Hard**: Analysis and synthesis questions demanding critical thinking
4. **God**: Advanced questions requiring mastery and creative problem-solving

### Question Types

- Multiple choice
- True/False
- Short answer
- Essay/long-form response

### AI Prompt Example

```
Based on the following topic content:
{topic_content}

Generate {num_questions} {difficulty_level} questions that test understanding of the material.
Include a mix of question types and provide the correct answers.
```

## Progress Tracking

The system uses several metrics to track progress:

1. Completion percentage of each topic
2. Performance on assessments
3. Time spent vs. estimated time
4. Pattern recognition for learning optimization

## Implementation Notes

- OpenAI GPT-4 is used for primary content analysis
- Responses are cached to reduce API costs
- Fallback mechanisms are in place for API failures
- User feedback loop improves AI accuracy over time
